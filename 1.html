<p>On Sunday, the singer Lana Del Rey suggested, via Twitter, that she was being sued by Radiohead for copyright infringement over supposed similarities between her <strong> “Get Free”</strong> and their “Creep.” “It’s true about the lawsuit,” she wrote. “Although I know my song wasn’t inspired by Creep, Radiohead feel it was and want 100% of the publishing - I offered up to 40 over the last few months but they will only accept 100. Their lawyers have been relentless, so we will deal with it in court.”</p>

<p>From the start, Del Rey’s announcement felt fishy.<br> “Inspired by” is awfully gentle language to describe a plagiarism allegation, and besides, Radiohead already conceded partial songwriting credit on “Creep” to Mike Hazlewood and Albert Hammond—years ago, a judge found that “Creep” too closely echoes “The Air That I Breathe,” a hit Hazelwood and Hammond wrote for the Hollies, in 1974—meaning the band itself doesn’t even control the whole of its publishing.</br> Eventually, Warner/Chappell*,</P> <p>Radiohead’s publisher at the time of the song’s release, refuted her claim: “It’s clear that the verses of ‘Get Free’ use musical elements found in the verses of ‘Creep’ and we’ve requested that this be acknowledged in favor of all writers of ‘Creep,’ ” the company said in a statement. “To set the record straight, no lawsuit has been issued and Radiohead have not said they ‘will only accept 100%’ of the publishing of ‘Get Free.’ ”</p>

<p>Does “Get Free” plainly resemble “Creep” more than “Creep” plainly resembles “The Air That I Breathe”? Probably? If you think about it for too long, the question itself begins to feel paradoxical. They are all the same song; they are all different songs. What’s fair from a legal position—how many permutations within a finite range of musical notes can we expect to organically repeat?—is, as ever, comically unclear. Intellectual property should be protected—an artist’s work has no less proprietary value than a corporation’s, and of course it deserves strident safeguarding. Yet there is always a degree of absurdity to these disputes, which, independent of direct and objective mimicry, tend to be predicated on interpretive leaps—on sniffing out what a song “feels” like, and whether or not that feel has been repurposed egregiously.</p>

<p>The fundamental instability of that math could, eventually, necessitate an entire rethinking of the creative process. The situation has felt especially dire in the wake of a now infamous lawsuit, in 2013, over Robin Thicke’s colossal hit “Blurred Lines,” which a jury found too derivative of Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up”—despite nary an overlapping chord progression.</p>
